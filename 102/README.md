Hi, my name is Steve.  I am a Technical Account Manager for Five9.  I enjoy coding, and working out in my spare time.

#### What growth mindset means to me is...

Is being able to improve skills with effort and consistent practice, and to not be so critical of myself.  For instance, I enjoy [kiteboarding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SocuyRefqM), but because of where I live, I can usually only practice when I go on vacation.  Sometimes it feels like I'm learning all over again each year. Regardless of what you're doing or want to do, there is always room for improvement, and continued growth, whether it is personal or professional. The most important for me is to know that failure is a part of success. Most people that are successful have failed many times, but eventually were successful because they didn't quit. I might not have seen these failures, so I cannot compare myself to others.


- Reminder 1 - *Everyone makes mistakes and mistakes are opportunities to learn.*
- Reminder 2 - *I can improve my skills with effort and consistent practice.*
- Reminder 3 - *I only fail when I __stop__ trying.*
